# Stress Detection with Machine Learning

Stress, anxiety, and depression are threatening the mental health of people. Every person has a reason for having a stressful life. People often share their feelings on social media platforms like Instagram in the form of posts and stories, and on Reddit by asking for suggestions about their life on subreddits. In recent years, many content creators have come forward to create content to help people with their mental health.

Many organizations can use stress detection to identify which social media users are stressed, allowing them to provide timely support. If you want to learn how to use machine learning to detect stress in social media posts, this project is for you. In this project, I will guide you through the task of stress detection with machine learning using Python.

## Project Overview

This project utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze text data for stress detection. The steps involved include:

1. **Data Collection**: Gather a dataset of social media posts or create a sample dataset for testing.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean the text data using libraries like `neattext`.
3. **Model Training**: Use a machine learning model (Logistic Regression in this case) to classify text as "stressed" or "not stressed".
4. **Deployment**: Create a web application using Streamlit for real-time stress detection.

## Technologies Used
